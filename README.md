CODE STRUCTURE 

Quaddle is organized into clear, modular files that separate structure, style, and behavior. Each main page (home feed, category view, service details, and user profile) has its own HTML file, while a shared CSS file controls the visual design across the app. JavaScript files handle interactivity, including rendering service posts, filtering and sorting content, managing user accounts, and storing data locally to keep the app responsive and easy to maintain.
